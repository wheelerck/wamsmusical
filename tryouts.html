        <p>One of the greatest things about the WAMS musicals is that is all-inclusive. No matter what, you will get a part. Even so, you will still need to try out so Mrs. Schaubroeck knows your abilities. Here is how your audition will work...</p>
        <h2>Pre-Tryout</h2>
        <p>The tryout process is very simple. Mrs. Schaubroeck will have a sign up sheet somewhere in her room, and you will sign up for a tryout after school on one of the two days given. You will have intervals to sign up in, each interval being about ten minutes. You will also take and fill out an audition form, in which you will put your name, grade, and other information, like whether or not you have acted before and what other hobbies you have. </p>
        <h2>Tryout Time</h2>
        <p>When it comes time for your tryout, you must have your audition form to hand to Mrs. Schaubroeck. You will be asked what song you are going to sing, after which Mrs. Schaubroeck will let you sing a small bit of your prepared piece. If possible, you will be asked to read off the script, so Mrs. Schaubroeck can get a feel of which character will fit you best. After that, there's nothing to do but wait in anticipation for the first practice, where you will find out which incredible character from the musical you will inherit.</p>
