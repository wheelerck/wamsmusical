        <h2>How The Shows Work</h2>
        <p>You will have five shows in total, and four days of the shows. The first day you will perform for the 6th grade. The second day is 7th grade, and the third day is 8th grade. The shows will all be during the WIN, or choice class, and related arts of the different grades. The evening of the third day will also be opening night for the community, so make sure you rest your voice as much as possible. The show is at 7:00. The fourth and final day will be the matinee show, so it will be at 2:00. Mrs. Schaubroeck will give you a set time you must be at the middle school before the performance so you have time to get ready.</p> 
        <h2>The End of Your Journey</h2>
        <p>Once the performance starts, it will be just like any other practice. The only difference will be the incredible sense of accomplishment you get from performing in front of your friends and family. Whether making them laugh or having them feel the emotions you character is feeling, it is truly the most memorable moment of the performances. </p>
