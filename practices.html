        <h2>The First Practice</h2>
        <p>The first practice is very simple. It is from 2:30-3:00 after school. This is when you will find out your part, and read-throughs are started. You will also get your script the first day. </p>
        <p>If you have busy schedules, don't worry. Practices are only 3 to 4 times a week, so you'll always have at least one day off to rest. After the first practice, the rest go something like this...</p>
        <h2>What You Will Do In Practices</h2>
        <p>The first few practices are read-throughs, which is exactly what it sounds like; you read through the script. Then of course there's music, as it is a musical. At first, you will just listen to the songs and Mrs. Schaubroeck will tell you your parts and the harmonies you will sing within the music. After that, you start singing the songs with the voices in the back track. By the end, you start singing the songs with a karaoke track, which is what you will do when it comes time for the performance. After that, you will start blocking. This is when you start using the stage, and finding your spots for each scene, such as where you will stand and which way you walk off stage when it comes time.  </p>
            <h2>Off-Script</h2>
        <p>When it comes close to the end of the practices, you will have to go off-script, which is exactly what it sounds like. By this time, it is expected that you know your lines, so you can focus more in-depth on blocking and other essentials. If you mess up or forget a little bit of a line, that's ok! Everybody makes mistakes. Just make sure you have overall memorized your lines. </p>
        <h2 div class="sub-heading">Times</h2>
        <p>The first practice is from 2:30 to 3:00 after school, so you can go home on the activity bus. Afterwards, they gradually get longer as the show nears, so there is more time to practices and perfect different scenes as needed. They will end at first at 3:30, then it will be 4:00 and 4:30, and tech week will be until 6:00.</p>
