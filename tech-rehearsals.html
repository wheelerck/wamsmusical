        <h2>Tech Rehearsals: The Week Before Performances</h2> 
        <p>Tech week is personally my favorite part of the practices. It is when you can really start getting into your character, because this is the time when you start wearing costumes. Makeup, if necessary, won't be worn until the shows, so you don't have to worry about it during tech. Throughout tech week, you will figure out costumes and mics, as well as thoroughly getting down music, lines, and entrance timing. The practices will go from 2:30 to 6:00 pm and are absolutely mandatory. These practices are a bit higher in intensity compared to other practices, as they are the last practices before the performances, so you are getting to the grit of everything. You want the play to be as perfect as possible, but it is still ok to make mistakes, so don't stress about it. </p>
