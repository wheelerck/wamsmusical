       <div class="description"> <p div class="intro">There are multiple jobs needed to run a musical, and musicals are always phenomenally better when you put effort into every second possible. For the WAMS musicals, there are about two months of practices before the performances. To make a musical, you of course need actors and actresses of all talents. But stage crew and faculty also play a major part.</p> <p>To start, you need to have a director, otherwise it's complete anarchy. In some cases, you will also have a co-director to help. You also will have a choreographer, who makes the dances. Without him/her, you would just have a bunch of people standing around awkwardly while singing. You also need a sound person, so your microphones work come time for the show, as well as a lights person so the stage isn't completely dark. And, as it is a musical, there will also be a person to start the music at the correct moments. As you can see, a musical needs so many different people to make it work. Here are a few teachers who volunteered to make the WAMS musicals as amazing as they are.</p></div>
